# 12.06.24

**Known Bugs/Todos remaining:**
- ~~Fix bugs with the reading of the raw metadata~~
- ~~provide a starting state to marvin~~
- iteratively update the state to validate more regularly (need more concrete feedback)
- generate some nicer figures, approach the figure business more systematically
- create some red line for the thesis, which questions need to be answered

**Thoughts**
- There are some metadata foramts whihc encrypt their data to sth like unit: 8
where 8 is by definition mm. This will be hard for an LLM to know
